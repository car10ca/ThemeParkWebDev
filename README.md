# Virtuality Theme Park Website
Welcome to the Virtuality Theme Park repository! This was my very first web development project, created entirely from scratch in 2021 as part of my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science at the University of London.

## Project Overview
The project involved designing and building a website as a team of four. Our goal was to create an engaging and interactive online presence for a theme park. After brainstorming, we decided on a virtual reality-themed park tailored for gamers, aptly named Virtuality.

### Key Features
- **Theme Park Attractions:** Sections include Virtual Reality, eSports, Retro Gaming, and Casino experiences, each with dedicated pages and information.
- **Interactive Elements:**
  - Image carousels to showcase attractions.
  - Drop-down navigation menus.
  - VR-themed animations like floating shapes and Pac-Man effects.
- **Accessibility & Responsiveness:** Designed for all ages, featuring wheelchair-friendly navigation and modern web standards.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Structured content and semantic web design.
- **CSS3:** Animations, styles, and responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript:** Interactive features, including the carousel functionality.
- **Google Fonts:** Unique typography to enhance the futuristic, gaming aesthetic.

## My Contributions
Leveraging my 15 years of experience in graphic design, I focused on crafting a visually appealing and cohesive user interface, including:

- Designing the website layout and navigation flow.
- Implementing graphics and animations aligned with the gaming theme.
- Ensuring a vibrant yet professional aesthetic.
- CSS & HTML to W3C standard

### Learning Outcomes
This project marked the beginning of my journey in re-entering web development. It re-introduced me to foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while demonstrating the power of collaboration in a team environment.

## Possible Improvements
Although the Virtuality Theme Park website was a successful first project given the circumstances of a university group project, there are several areas where it could be improved:

### 1. Dynamic Content
- Replace static HTML with a backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Flask) to dynamically generate content.
- Add a CMS (Content Management System) for easier updates to attractions and park information.

### 2. Accessibility Enhancements
- Improve compliance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) by adding ARIA roles and improving keyboard navigation.
- Enhance text contrast and ensure all interactive elements are easily distinguishable.

### 3. Improved Responsiveness
- Optimize the layout for smaller devices, ensuring better navigation and readability.
- Refactor CSS for modern techniques like Flexbox and Grid.

### 4. Enhanced User Interactivity
- Incorporate interactive maps for attractions using a properly secured Google Maps API or a JavaScript library like Leaflet.js.
- Add features like ticket booking directly on the website.

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Minify CSS, JavaScript, and images to improve page load times.
- Use lazy loading for images and asynchronous loading for scripts.

### 6. Security Improvements
- Remove hardcoded API keys and replace them with secure environment variables.
- Perform regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

### 7. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
- Refactor metadata for better indexing by search engines.
- Add structured data (JSON-LD) to enhance search result visibility.
