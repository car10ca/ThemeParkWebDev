# Virtuality Theme Park Website
Welcome to the Virtuality Theme Park repository! This was my very first web development project, created entirely from scratch in 2021 as part of my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science at the University of London.

## Project Overview
The project involved designing and building a website as a team of four. Our goal was to create an engaging and interactive online presence for a theme park. After brainstorming, we decided on a virtual reality-themed park tailored for gamers, aptly named Virtuality.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Elements:**
  - Image carousels to showcase attractions.
  - Drop-down navigation menus.
  - VR-themed animations like floating shapes and Pac-Man effects.
- **Accessibility & Responsiveness:** Designed for all ages, featuring wheelchair-friendly navigation and modern web standards.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Structured content and semantic web design.
- **CSS3:** Animations, styles, and responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript:** Interactive features, including the carousel functionality.
- **Google Fonts:** Unique typography to enhance the futuristic, gaming aesthetic.

## My Contributions
Leveraging my 15 years of experience in graphic design, I focused on crafting a visually appealing and cohesive user interface, including:

- Designing the website layout and navigation flow.
- Implementing graphics and animations aligned with the gaming theme.
- Ensuring a vibrant yet professional aesthetic.
