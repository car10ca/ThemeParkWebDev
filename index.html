          <h2>Explore the science of VR</h2>
          <p>
            We believe that VR (virtual reality) strongly improves the capacity of the human
            mind to learn and apply the concepts learned. We also believe in technological
            literacy, that exploring art and design in the act of creation (steam) coupled
            with technology, science, engineering and math (stem) leads to the innovation
            leaders that vr world supports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our educational experiences are carefully chosen to engage youth across several
            disciplines including natural history, math, anatomy, physics, art, and design.
            We offer a unique environment to explore. VR Worldâ€™s immersive lessons and curriculum
            are crafted to engage and inspire students from introduction to conclusion. Visitors
            will not only experience but create with our unique content.
